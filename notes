Exchanges

• Direct - A direct exchange delivers messages to queues based on a message routing
key. In a direct exchange, the message is routed to the queue with the exact match
of binding key as the routing key of the message. For example, if the queue is bound
to the exchange using the binding key ‘pdfprocess’, a message published to the
exchange with a routing key ‘pdfprocess’ is routed to that queue.
• Topic - The topic exchange performs a wildcard match between the routing key and
the routing pattern specified in the binding.
• Fanout - A fanout exchange routes messages to all of the queues that are bound to
it.
• Headers - A header exchange uses the message header attributes for routing
purposes.
